  <h1>Web Typography Rendering.</h1>
  <p>Type in Photoshop is rendered within the Operating System.  It has access to the library of fonts and font licensing in Photoshop is completely different than it is for web use.</p>
  <p>Ultimately, and this is a real tough one, type will most likely not render in Photoshop like it will online until Adobe works out some of it's issues.</p>
  <p>I wish there was a better answer, but there isn't.  Untill type is online, it's best considered FPO.</p>
