  <h1>Intro: Photoshop != CSS</h1>
  <p>Photoshop is an incredible tool for web design and offers a robust suite of tools to generate digital graphics for use in web production. Because of it's versatility, ease of use, and reliability, it's become the industry standard for creating webpages.</p>
  <p>However, Photoshop does not generate CSS.  Photoshop was built as and continues to be a tool primarily for munipulating digital photography.  A PSD in it's current form can not output CSS and HTML natively.  Fireworks can, but Fireworks sucks at doing it.</p>
  <p>Because of Photoshops inability to speak a native web langauge .</p>
