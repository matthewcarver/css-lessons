  <h1>Intro: Photoshop != CSS</h1>
  <p>Photoshop is an incredible tool for web design and offers a robust suite of tools to generate digital graphics for use in web production. Because of it's versatility, ease of use, and reliability, it's become the industry standard for creating webpages.</p>
  <p>However, Photoshop does not generate CSS.  Photoshop was built as and continues to be a tool primarily for munipulating digital photography.  A PSD in it's current form can not output CSS and HTML natively.  Fireworks can, but Fireworks sucks at doing it.</p>
  <p>Because of Photoshops inability to speak a native web langauge, developers spend a lot of time translating PSDs into webpages.  It's a time consuming process know as "front-end development" and some of us make a damn fine living doing it.</p>
  <p>Once a project is mirrored from a PSD into CSS a lot of times it can feel like a "spot the difference" from Highlights magazine.</p>

  <p>One little tweak grows out of control, and the PSD has to be mirrored on mobile, tablet, and across browsers.  One thing leads to another and suddenly what began as a minor touch up job becomes this:</p>

  <p>Which makes everyone look like assholes.</p>
